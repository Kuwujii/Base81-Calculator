## Used Base81 notation
Because I couldn't find any standard over Base64 that is intended for doing math in it (the closest I could find is Base85 which is just ASCII) I created two separate systems that will be usable in the calcultor. One of them contains characters that aren't used in math allowing it to be decently readable and the other one which uses them but it allows it to be easilly typed on a keyboard. They might change or new ones might appear as I develop this project.

Current Table:
| Base10 | Base81$_{0}$ | Base81$_{1}$ |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 0-9    | 0-9          | 0-9          |
| 10-35  | A-Z          | A-Z          |
| 36-61  | a-z          | a-z          |
| 62     | &            | &            |
